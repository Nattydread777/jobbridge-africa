## Overview

- Two apps in one repo:
  - `backend/` — Node/Express API with MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT auth via httpOnly cookies, Cloudinary file storage
  - `frontend/` — React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4, React Router 7
- Authentication: JWT in httpOnly cookies (CORS-enabled)
- Storage: MongoDB Atlas (recommended) and Cloudinary (profile photos, resumes)
- Profile completion: 7-part scoring system used to gate job application readiness

## SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth

United Nations SDG 8 promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.

Key challenges in many African contexts

- High youth unemployment and underemployment; large NEET population
- Informal labor markets with limited protections and low wages
- Skills mismatch between education outputs and employer needs
- Geographic constraints and limited access to quality opportunities
- Low hiring transparency and weak employer–talent signaling

How JobBridge Africa helps

- Access: Centralized job discovery across countries and cities with filters and AI recommendations
- Employability: Profile completion guidance (photo, resume, education, experience, skills) to help candidates present job-ready profiles
- Matching: AI-assisted matching routes job seekers to relevant roles, reducing search friction and employer screening costs
- Inclusion: Remote and flexible roles surfaced to reduce geographic and mobility barriers
- Employer enablement: Simple tools for posting and managing jobs, improving transparency and response
- Data foundation: Structured profiles and application data to inform future analytics on skills gaps and training needs

Planned impact extensions

- Learning and upskilling pathways linked to skills gaps and local market needs
- Youth engagement campaigns and referral programs
- Monetization that sustains the platform while preserving open access for job seekers

## SDG 8 Targets Mapping

| SDG Target                                                                                                | Challenge Addressed                                    | How JobBridge Africa Contributes                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8.2: Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, tech upgrade, and innovation | Low productivity, skills not aligned with market needs | AI job matching, structured profiles, and future analytics help align talent with productive sectors |
| 8.5: Full and productive employment and decent work for all, equal pay for work of equal value            | Underemployment, barriers for women and youth          | Inclusive access to roles (incl. remote), transparent listings, and better employer–talent signaling |
| 8.6: Substantially reduce youth not in employment, education, or training (NEET)                          | High youth unemployment/NEET rates                     | Profile completion guidance, resume support, and planned learning pathways to improve employability  |

This mapping will evolve as we implement learning integrations, mentorship, and community features.

### Roadmap (Phased)

| Phase   | Focus              | Key Items                                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Core hiring loop   | Profiles with completion, job CRUD, applications, Cloudinary uploads            |
| Phase 2 | Matching & quality | AI matching improvements, resume parsing pipeline, skills gap hints             |
| Phase 3 | Monetization       | Employer subscriptions, credits, featured jobs, payments (Paystack/Flutterwave) |
| Phase 4 | Community & chat   | Job seeker networking, employer–applicant chat (Socket.IO), moderation tools    |
| Phase 5 | Analytics & i18n   | Insights dashboards, i18n, accessibility, notifications                         |

## Architecture

- API server (`backend/server.js`) exposes REST endpoints under `/api/*`
- Frontend (`frontend/`) consumes API via Axios (`src/services/api.js`)
- Auth via JWT cookie, validated by `protect` middleware
- Role-based access: `employer` middleware restricts job management
- File uploads
  - Profile images: memory upload → Cloudinary (face-centered 400×400 crop)
  - Resumes: uploaded on application submit → Cloudinary (converted to PDF when possible)
- Data persistence: MongoDB with Mongoose models (User, Job, Application)

## Tech Stack & Tools

Backend

- Node.js, Express, Mongoose
- JWT (`jsonwebtoken`), `cookie-parser`, `cors`, `dotenv`
- `multer` for uploads, `cloudinary` SDK
- Dev: `nodemon`

Frontend

- React 19, React Router 7
- Vite (rolldown-vite), Tailwind CSS v4
- Axios, ESLint 9

Infrastructure

- MongoDB Atlas (recommended)
- Cloudinary: media storage for images/resumes

---

## Local Development (Windows)

Prereqs

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas connection string (or local MongoDB)
- Cloudinary account (cloud name, API key, API secret)

Clone and install

```powershell
# From the folder where you want the project
cd $HOME\Desktop
# If already cloned, skip the next line
# SSH:
# git clone git@github.com:Nattydread777/jobbridge-africa.git JOBBRIDGE-AFRICA
cd JOBBRIDGE-AFRICA

# Install backend deps
cd backend; npm install; cd ..

# Install frontend deps
cd frontend; npm install; cd ..
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` with at least:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=<your mongodb uri>

# JWT and cookie
JWT_SECRET=<random-long-secret>
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
COOKIE_EXPIRE=7

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLIENT_NAME=<cloud_name>
CLOUDINARY_CLIENT_API=<api_key>
CLOUDINARY_CLIENT_SECRET=<api_secret>
```

Notes

- For production, update CORS origin in `backend/server.js` to your frontend domain.
- Frontend currently points to `http://localhost:4000/api` in `frontend/src/services/api.js`.

Optional frontend `.env` (future enhancement)

- You can refactor `api.js` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE`.

---

## Running the App

Run backend API

```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev  # uses nodemon
```

API server will start on http://localhost:4000

Run frontend (in a second terminal)

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Vite dev server starts (usually on http://localhost:5173)

If `npm run dev` fails in the frontend, ensure Node 18+ is installed and dependencies are correctly installed. Try `npm install` again.

---

## Data Models

User

- role: `job_seeker | employer | admin`
- Profile fields: `country`, `bio` (<= 300 chars), `education[]`, `experience[]`, `skills[]`
- Media: `profileImageUrl/profileImagePublicId`, `resumeUrl`
- Employer: `companyName`

Job

- Fields: `title, companyName, company (User ref), location, jobType, salaryRange, description, requirements, responsibilities, benefits, expiryDate, applicationEmail, postedBy`

Application

- Fields: `job (ref), applicant (ref), coverLetter, resumeUrl, resumePublicId, status`
- Status lifecycle: `pending → reviewed → shortlisted → rejected/accepted`

---

## Profile Completion Logic

For job seekers, completion is computed out of 7 checks:

1. Profile photo (`profileImageUrl`)
2. Resume (`resumeUrl`)
3. Country
4. Bio
5. Education array has entries
6. Experience array has entries
7. Skills array has entries

Application gating

- Applying to jobs checks for required profile elements. Completion UI is shown on Dashboard, Profile, and Profile View pages.

---

## Code Quality & Linting

Frontend

- ESLint 9 + React hooks & refresh plugins
- Tailwind CSS v4 (PostCSS plugin via Vite)

Run lint

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

---

## Deployment Notes

- Backend
  - Set `NODE_ENV=production`
  - Update CORS allowed origin in `backend/server.js`
  - Provide all env vars in production environment
- Frontend
  - Build with `npm run build` and serve via static host or CDN
  - Point API base to your backend domain (update `src/services/api.js` or use env)
- Cloudinary
  - Ensure the configured Cloudinary account and folder conventions exist

---

## Contributing

- Fork and create a feature branch
- Follow existing code style and file structure
- Add tests where feasible (controllers/routes)
- For UI, keep Tailwind utility-first approach consistent
- Open a PR describing the change and screenshots where relevant
